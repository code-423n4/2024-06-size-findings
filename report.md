# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Size smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between June 10 â€” July 2, 2024.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L249><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L256>

### Impact

The protocol might receive a lower fee than expected when `sellCreditMarket()` is called to sell credit for a specific cash amount.

### Proof of Concept

The protocol allows a user to sell their `credit` for `szaUSDC`, which can be used to redeem USDC thereafter.
- If a specific amount of `credit` is sold for `szaUSDC`, `sellCreditMarket()` will calculate the amount of `szaUSDC` received and `fees` paid to `feeReceipient`.
- If `credit` is sold for a specific amount of `szaUSDC`, `sellCreditMarket()` will calculate the amount of `credit` sold and `fees` paid to `feeReceipient`.

The calculation should follow the below rules:

*Note: please see the calculation scenarios in warden's [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/288).*

We can verify [the fee samples](https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/2.3-fees) with the above formulas.

**Example 1**: Bob owned 120 `credit` and sell 120 `credit` to Candy for `szaUSDC`. All results of the calculation are same as [Example 1](https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/2.3-fees).

**Example 2** : Bob owned 120 `credit` and sell `credit` to Candy for 50 `szaUSDC`. However, the swap fee stated in [Example 2](https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/2.3-fees) is 0.5, which is different with the result calculated from in the formulas.

The sold credit and swap fee are calculated in [`getCreditAmountIn()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L253-L256):

```solidity
253:            creditAmountIn = Math.mulDivUp(
254:                cashAmountOut + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee, PERCENT + ratePerTenor, PERCENT - swapFeePercent
255:            );
256:            fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT) + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
```

As we can see, the calculation of `creditAmountIn` is same as the calculation of `credit_{sold} (4)`; however, the swap fee is different. This leaves the protocol suffering a loss on swap fees when `sellCreditMarket()` is called to sell credit for a specific cash amount.

Copy the below codes to [SellCreditMarketTest.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/test/local/actions/SellCreditMarket.t.sol) and run `forge test --match-test test_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_incorrectFee`:

```solidity
    function test_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_incorrectFee() public {
        _deposit(bob, weth, 100e18);
        _deposit(alice, usdc, 100e6);
        _buyCreditLimit(alice, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(365 days, 0.2e18));
        uint256 tenor = 365 days;

        uint256 apr = size.getLoanOfferAPR(alice, tenor);
        //@audit-info alice has 100e6 szaUSDC 
        assertEq(size.getUserView(alice).borrowATokenBalance, 100e6);
        uint256 snapshot = vm.snapshot();
        //@audit-info bob sell 120e6 credit to alice for szaUSDC
        size.sellCreditMarket(
            SellCreditMarketParams({
                lender: alice,
                creditPositionId: RESERVED_ID,
                amount: 120e6,
                tenor: tenor,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                maxAPR: apr,
                exactAmountIn: true
            })
        );
        //@audit-info alice has 0 szaUSDC left
        assertEq(size.getUserView(alice).borrowATokenBalance, 0);
        //@audit-info bob received 99.5e6 szaUSDC
        assertEq(size.getUserView(bob).borrowATokenBalance, 99.5e6);
        //@audit-info bob owed 120e6 debt
        assertEq(size.getUserView(bob).debtBalance, 120e6);

        vm.revertTo(snapshot);
        //@audit-info bob sell credit to alice for 99.5e6 szaUSDC 
        size.sellCreditMarket(
            SellCreditMarketParams({
                lender: alice,
                creditPositionId: RESERVED_ID,
                amount: 99.5e6,
                tenor: tenor,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                maxAPR: apr,
                exactAmountIn: false
            })
        );
        //@audit-info alice has 2500 szaUSDC left
        assertEq(size.getUserView(alice).borrowATokenBalance, 2500);
        //@audit-info bob received 99.5e6 szaUSDC
        assertEq(size.getUserView(bob).borrowATokenBalance, 99.5e6);
        //@audit-info bob owed 120e6 debt
        assertEq(size.getUserView(bob).debtBalance, 120e6);
        //@audit-info feeRecipient received 497500 szaUSDC as fee
        assertEq(size.getUserView(feeRecipient).borrowATokenBalance, 497500);
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Correct the swap fee calculation:

```diff
    function getCreditAmountIn(
        State storage state,
        uint256 cashAmountOut,
        uint256 maxCashAmountOut,
        uint256 maxCredit,
        uint256 ratePerTenor,
        uint256 tenor
    ) internal view returns (uint256 creditAmountIn, uint256 fees) {
        uint256 swapFeePercent = getSwapFeePercent(state, tenor);

        uint256 maxCashAmountOutFragmentation = 0;

        if (maxCashAmountOut >= state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee) {
            maxCashAmountOutFragmentation = maxCashAmountOut - state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
        }

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (cashAmountOut == maxCashAmountOut) {
            // no credit fractionalization

            creditAmountIn = maxCredit;
-           fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT);
+           fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT - swapFeePercent);
        } else if (cashAmountOut < maxCashAmountOutFragmentation) {
            // credit fractionalization

            creditAmountIn = Math.mulDivUp(
                cashAmountOut + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee, PERCENT + ratePerTenor, PERCENT - swapFeePercent
            );
-            fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT) + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
+            fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee, swapFeePercent, PERCENT - swapFeePercent) + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
        } else {
            // for maxCashAmountOutFragmentation < amountOut < maxCashAmountOut we are in an inconsistent situation
            //   where charging the swap fee would require to sell a credit that exceeds the max possible credit

            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_CASH(maxCashAmountOutFragmentation, cashAmountOut);
        }
    }
```

> This issue is an incorrect implementation of the swap fees formula described in the technical documentation, resulting in less fee collection in the credit swapping process.  
> 
> In our opinion, this should not be categorized as a "High" issue since it only negatively affects the protocol owners, because in the current version, there is no mechanism for fees redistribution, so no user category (lenders / credit buyers, borrowers / credit sellers, and liquidators) is negatively affected.  In fact, the user who is subject to fee payment would have benefited from this issue since he would have ended up paying lower fees than expected.

## [[H-02] Risk of overpayment due to race condition between `repay` and `liquidateWithReplacement` transactions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/181)
*Submitted by [elhaj](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/181), also found by [KupiaSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/147), [mt030d](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/100), and [VAD37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/42)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L198-L201><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L229-L244>

### Impact

- **Likelihood**: Medium - Users and liquidation bots are likely to call their respective functions around the same time.
- **Impact**: High - Users end up repaying more than double their future value.

### Proof of Concept

The `LiquidateWithReplacement` mechanism in the Size protocol allows a permissioned role (`KEEPER_ROLE`) to perform the liquidation of a debt position by replacing an unhealthy borrower with a healthier one from the order book. Here's how it works:

1. The debt position of the unhealthy borrower is liquidated, and the `futureValue` is paid to the Size contract by the liquidator,while the liquidator gets an equivalent amount plus reward in terms of collateral tokens from the unhealthy borrower.
2. The borrower of this `debtPosition` is updated to the new healthier borrower.
3. The debt position retains its same `futureValue` and `ID`.
4. A portion of the repaid funds is used to fund a new borrower.

    function executeLiquidateWithReplacement(State storage state, LiquidateWithReplacementParams calldata params)
        external
        returns (uint256 issuanceValue, uint256 liquidatorProfitCollateralToken, uint256 liquidatorProfitBorrowToken)
    {
      // some code ...
/*1*/>>    liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = state.executeLiquidate(LiquidateParams({debtPositionId: params.debtPositionId, minimumCollateralProfit: params.minimumCollateralProfit}));

        uint256 ratePerTenor = borrowOffer.getRatePerTenor(
            VariablePoolBorrowRateParams({
                variablePoolBorrowRate: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRate,
                variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt,
                variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval
            }),
            tenor
        );
        issuanceValue = Math.mulDivDown(debtPositionCopy.futureValue, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor);
        liquidatorProfitBorrowToken = debtPositionCopy.futureValue - issuanceValue;

/*2*/>>      debtPosition.borrower = params.borrower;
/*3*/>>      debtPosition.futureValue = debtPositionCopy.futureValue;
        debtPosition.liquidityIndexAtRepayment = 0;

        emit Events.UpdateDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId, debtPosition.borrower, debtPosition.futureValue, debtPosition.liquidityIndexAtRepayment);
        // @note : in this case the borrower doesn't pay swapFees
          state.data.debtToken.mint(params.borrower, debtPosition.futureValue);
/*4*/>>   state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(address(this), params.borrower, issuanceValue);
          state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(address(this), state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, liquidatorProfitBorrowToken);
    }
```

By maintaining the same debt position ID and future value, lenders (all credit holders of this debt position) can still expect repayment on the original due date.

On the other hand, a user can always `repay` a debt position. To repay, the user specifies the `ID` of the debt position and calls the `repay` function, which repays the loan of the specified debt position.

```js
    function executeRepay(State storage state, RepayParams calldata params) external {
        DebtPosition storage debtPosition = state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId);

        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtPosition.futureValue);
        debtPosition.liquidityIndexAtRepayment = state.data.borrowAToken.liquidityIndex();
        state.repayDebt(params.debtPositionId, debtPosition.futureValue);

        emit Events.Repay(params.debtPositionId);
    }
```

The issue arises when a borrower sends a transaction to `repay` their debt position when it becomes liquidatable, but a `liquidateWithReplacement` transaction is executed just before the user's transaction. This way, the user will be liquidated, and their collateral will be used to repay debt. Since `liquidateWithReplacement` only changes the borrower of a `debtPosition`, the user ends up paying the debt of another borrower immediately, resulting in the user repaying more than double their future value (more than 2x because of liquidation rewards).

This doesn't require a malicious keeper (who calls `liquidateWithReplacement`) as it's trusted, it can happen unintentionally, and there is a pretty good chance for this to occur; as users and the liquidator (keeper bot in this case) will probably call their respective functions around the same time.

When a user notices that their position is liquidatable (probably through a UI notification), there is a high chance they will repay their debt to avoid liquidation, and the same goes for the liquidation bot. Thus, there is a good chance that the `liquidateWithReplacement` transaction will be executed before the user's repayment transaction. The impact is high here, as the user ends up paying 2x their debt.

In case `liquidateWithReplacement` becomes permissionless and anyone can call it, this will be critically exploitable. An exploit scenario would be:

1. The collateral token price drops, making Bob's position liquidatable.
2. Bob gets notified and sends a transaction to repay his debt position with `ID=0`.
3. Alice sees Bob's transaction in the mempool and front-runs him to liquidate the debt position with `ID=0`, setting herself as the borrower (it can set any curve borrow offer). An equivalent amount to the `futureValue` in terms of collateral tokens is sent from Bob's account to Alice, and Alice receives another cash of `borrowAToken` since she's the borrower.
4. Bob's transaction gets executed after that, and Bob ends up paying Alice's debt. Bob suffers loss.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To prevent unintended debt repayment due to borrower changes, users should specify both the borrower address and the debt position ID when repaying. This ensures users have control over who they are repaying for, avoiding scenarios where they might repay another borrower's debt due to a recent `liquidateWithReplacement` transaction.

Make this changes in [repay lib](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/Repay.sol):

```diff
    struct RepayParams {
        uint256 debtPositionId;
+        address borrower;
    }

   function validateRepay(State storage state, RepayParams calldata params) external view {
        // validate debtPositionId
        if (state.getLoanStatus(params.debtPositionId) == LoanStatus.REPAID) {
            revert Errors.LOAN_ALREADY_REPAID(params.debtPositionId);
        }
+        if (state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId).borrower != params.borrower) revert("invalid borrower");

        // validate msg.sender
        // N/A
    }
```

However, in that case, the replacement is extremely unlikely to happen since it would require a borrower willing to borrow passively for a very short tenor. This is very unlikely to happen as a borrower would need some time to react to his limit borrow order being filled and quickly decide what to do with the borrowed money, before this new loan goes overdue and he becomes eligible for liquidation.

> On top of this, the `liquidateWithReplacement()` method is permissioned and we have a negligible economic incentive in running it vs a standard liquidation. This is because the latter is unaffected by the issue mentioned above since the value the protocol captures from running a liquidation with replacement is proportional to the remaining loan lifetime. It would therefore be a net loss to use `liquidateWithReplacement()` instead of `liquidate()` for a loan very close to maturity as we would gain almost nothing while potentially significantly affecting our users.

## [[H-03] The collateral remainder cap is incorrectly calculated during liquidation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/70)
*Submitted by [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/70), also found by [hyh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/231), [samuraii77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/214), [m4k2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/188), [KupiaSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/140), [stakog](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/98), [AMOW](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/73), [jsmi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/369), and [Bob](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/178)*

When a position is overdue, it can be liquidated even if the owner has a sufficient collateral ratio. Some rewards are sent to the liquidator as an incentive and some fees are assigned to the protocol. However, the calculation of the protocol fee is flawed due to an incorrect collateral remainder cap calculation.

Imagine the collateral ratio for liquidation is set at 130%. The collateral equivalent to the debt should be paid to the protocol, and the excess collateral (30%) can be the remainder cap. Currently, the entire 130% is treated as the remainder cap, leading to an unfair situation where a user with a 150% collateral ratio experiences more loss than a user with a 140% CR.

This discourages users with higher CRs, who generally contribute to the protocol's health. If higher CRs result in greater losses, it disincentivizes users from providing sufficient collateral to the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine Bob and Candy have the same debt position, and these positions are overdue.
- The collateral ratio for liquidation is 130%.
- Candy has a 150% collateral ratio, and Bob has a 140% CR.

Both positions are liquidated by liquidators:

    function executeLiquidate(State storage state, LiquidateParams calldata params)
        external
        returns (uint256 liquidatorProfitCollateralToken)
    {
        DebtPosition storage debtPosition = state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId);
        LoanStatus loanStatus = state.getLoanStatus(params.debtPositionId);
        uint256 collateralRatio = state.collateralRatio(debtPosition.borrower)

        uint256 collateralProtocolPercent = state.isUserUnderwater(debtPosition.borrower)
            ? state.feeConfig.collateralProtocolPercent
            : state.feeConfig.overdueCollateralProtocolPercent;

        uint256 assignedCollateral = state.getDebtPositionAssignedCollateral(debtPosition);  // @1
        uint256 debtInCollateralToken = state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(debtPosition.futureValue); // @2
        uint256 protocolProfitCollateralToken = 0;

        // profitable liquidation
        if (assignedCollateral > debtInCollateralToken) {
            uint256 liquidatorReward = Math.min(
                assignedCollateral - debtInCollateralToken,
                Math.mulDivUp(debtPosition.futureValue, state.feeConfig.liquidationRewardPercent, PERCENT)
            );  // @3
            liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = debtInCollateralToken + liquidatorReward;  

            // split the remaining collateral between the protocol and the borrower, capped by the crLiquidation
            uint256 collateralRemainder = assignedCollateral - liquidatorProfitCollateralToken;  // @4

            // cap the collateral remainder to the liquidation collateral ratio
            //   otherwise, the split for non-underwater overdue loans could be too much
            uint256 cllateralRemainderCap =
                Math.mulDivDown(debtInCollateralToken, state.riskConfig.crLiquidation, PERCENT);  // @5

            collateralRemainder = Math.min(collateralRemainder, collateralRemainderCap);

            protocolProfitCollateralToken = Math.mulDivDown(collateralRemainder, collateralProtocolPercent, PERCENT);  // @6
        } 
    }

`@1`: Calculate assigned collaterals to the debt position. The amount assigned from Candy's collateral is larger than that from Bob's.<br>
`@2`: Convert the debt token to the collateral token. The converted amounts are the same for both users.<br>
`@3`: Calculate the reward for liquidation. These amounts are the same because the debt sizes are the same and both users have enough CR to cover the profit.<br>
`@4`: Calculate the collateral remainder. Candy obviously has a larger amount.<br>
`@5`: Calculate the collateral remainder cap. The cap should be 30%, but it is currently calculated as 130%, which is the CR for liquidation itself.<br>
`@6`: As a result, Candy will experience more loss than Bob due to their excess amounts (50%, 40%) being below the cap (130%).

If users know that they will experience more loss when they have a larger CR, they will tend to maintain their CR as low as possible. While they will try to avoid liquidation, there will be no users with a CR higher than, for example, 200%. This is detrimental to the protocol.

Liquidation is crucial, and all liquidatable positions must be liquidated to maintain the protocol's solvency. However, because the liquidator's profit is calculated incorrectly, users are not incentivized to liquidate unhealthy positions. This issue has a significant impact on the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

When the collateral ratio of a user falls below the specified threshold, the user's debt positions become liquidatable.

The liquidation process involves the following steps:

```
    function executeLiquidate(State storage state, LiquidateParams calldata params)
        external
        returns (uint256 liquidatorProfitCollateralToken)
    {
        DebtPosition storage debtPosition = state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId);
        LoanStatus loanStatus = state.getLoanStatus(params.debtPositionId);
        uint256 collateralRatio = state.collateralRatio(debtPosition.borrower);

        uint256 collateralProtocolPercent = state.isUserUnderwater(debtPosition.borrower)
            ? state.feeConfig.collateralProtocolPercent
            : state.feeConfig.overdueCollateralProtocolPercent;

        uint256 assignedCollateral = state.getDebtPositionAssignedCollateral(debtPosition);  // @audit, step 1
        uint256 debtInCollateralToken = state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(debtPosition.futureValue);  // @audit, step 2
        uint256 protocolProfitCollateralToken = 0;

        if (assignedCollateral > debtInCollateralToken) {
            uint256 liquidatorReward = Math.min(
                assignedCollateral - debtInCollateralToken,
                Math.mulDivUp(debtPosition.futureValue, state.feeConfig.liquidationRewardPercent, PERCENT)
            );  // @audit, step 3
            liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = debtInCollateralToken + liquidatorReward;

            ...
        } else {
            liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = assignedCollateral;
        }
    }
```

**Step 1:** Calculate the collateral assigned to the debt.
- For example, if the collateral is 100 ETH and the total debt is 1000 USDC, and the liquidated position's debt is 200 USDC, then 20 ETH is assigned to this debt.

**Step 2:** Convert debt tokens to collateral tokens.
- For instance, if 1 ETH equals 1000 USDC and the liquidated position's debt is 200 USDC, then this value converts to 0.2 ETH.

**Step 3:** Calculate the liquidator's profit if the assigned collateral to this position is larger than the debt value.
- Itâ€™s crucial to note that `assignedCollateral` and `debtInCollateralToken` values are denominated in ETH's decimal (18), whereas `debtPosition.futureValue` is denominated in USDC's decimal (6).
- As a result, the second value becomes extremely small, which fails to fully incentivize liquidators. This discrepancy is because the calculated profit is equal to the exact profit divided by `1e12`.

As you can see in the log below, the profit is calculated to be extremely small:

```
    future value in usdc        ==>  82814071
    future value in WETH        ==>  82814071000000000000
    assigned collateral in WETH ==>  100000000000000000000
    ********************
    liquidator profit in WETH   ==>  4140704
    exact profit in WETH        ==>  4140703550000000000
```

Please add below test to the `test/local/actions/Liquidate.t.sol`:

```
    function test_liquidate_profit_of_liquidator() public {
        uint256 rewardPercent = size.feeConfig().liquidationRewardPercent;

        // current reward percent is 5%
        assertEq(rewardPercent, 50000000000000000);

        _deposit(alice, weth, 100e18);
        _deposit(alice, usdc, 100e6);
        _deposit(bob, weth, 100e18);
        _deposit(liquidator, weth, 100e18);
        _deposit(liquidator, usdc, 100e6);

        _buyCreditLimit(alice, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(365 days, 0.03e18));
        uint256 debtPositionId = _sellCreditMarket(bob, alice, RESERVED_ID, 80e6, 365 days, false);

        _setPrice(1e18);
        assertTrue(size.isDebtPositionLiquidatable(debtPositionId));

        uint256 futureValue = size.getDebtPosition(debtPositionId).futureValue;
        uint256 assignedCollateral = size.getDebtPositionAssignedCollateral(debtPositionId);
        uint256 debtInCollateralToken =
            size.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(futureValue);
        
        console2.log('future value in usdc        ==> ', futureValue);
        console2.log('future value in WETH        ==> ', debtInCollateralToken);
        console2.log('assigned collateral in WETH ==> ', assignedCollateral);

        console2.log('********************');

        uint256 liquidatorProfit = _liquidate(liquidator, debtPositionId, 0);
        console2.log('liquidator profit in WETH   ==> ', liquidatorProfit - debtInCollateralToken);

        uint256 exactProfit = Math.min(
            assignedCollateral - debtInCollateralToken,
            Math.mulDivUp(debtInCollateralToken, rewardPercent, PERCENT)    
        );
        console2.log('exact profit in WETH        ==> ', exactProfit);
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the converted value to `ETH`:

```
    function executeLiquidate(State storage state, LiquidateParams calldata params)
        external
        returns (uint256 liquidatorProfitCollateralToken)
    {
        DebtPosition storage debtPosition = state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId);
        LoanStatus loanStatus = state.getLoanStatus(params.debtPositionId);
        uint256 collateralRatio = state.collateralRatio(debtPosition.borrower);

        uint256 collateralProtocolPercent = state.isUserUnderwater(debtPosition.borrower)
            ? state.feeConfig.collateralProtocolPercent
            : state.feeConfig.overdueCollateralProtocolPercent;

        uint256 assignedCollateral = state.getDebtPositionAssignedCollateral(debtPosition);
        uint256 debtInCollateralToken = state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(debtPosition.futureValue); 
        uint256 protocolProfitCollateralToken = 0;

        if (assignedCollateral > debtInCollateralToken) {
            uint256 liquidatorReward = Math.min(
                assignedCollateral - debtInCollateralToken,
    -            Math.mulDivUp(debtPosition.futureValue, state.feeConfig.liquidationRewardPercent, PERCENT)
    +            Math.mulDivUp(debtInCollateralToken, state.feeConfig.liquidationRewardPercent, PERCENT)
            ); 
            liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = debtInCollateralToken + liquidatorReward;

            ...
        } else {
            liquidatorProfitCollateralToken = assignedCollateral;
        }
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/Multicall.sol#L29><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/Multicall.sol#L37>

### Impact

The `multicall(bytes[] calldata _data)` function in the Size.sol contract does not work as intended. The intention of the `multicall(bytes[] calldata _data)` function is to allow users to access multiple functionalities of the Size protocol, such as a (deposit and repay) pair, by a single transaction to Size.sol:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L142>

```solidity
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata _data)
        public
        payable
        override(IMulticall)
        whenNotPaused
        returns (bytes[] memory results)
    {
        results = state.multicall(_data);
    }
```

The multicall function allows batch processing of multiple interactions with the protocol in a single transaction. This also allows users to take actions that would otherwise be denied due to deposit limits. One of these actions is a (deposit and repay) pair.

Let's say a credit-debt pair exists. Assume that the tenor of the debt is 1 year and the future value is `100ke6` USDC. Let's say the borrower decides to repay the loan just 1 day before the maturity ends. During this 1 year, the total supply of `borrowAToken` had increased so much that the total supply of `borrowAToken` was just `10e6` USDC worth below the cap (that is, just below the cap) at the time when the borrower decided to repay the loan.

To repay a loan, Size requires the user to have sufficient `borrowAToken`:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Repay.sol#L49>

```solidity
    function executeRepay(State storage state, RepayParams calldata params) external {
        DebtPosition storage debtPosition = state.getDebtPosition(params.debtPositionId);

        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtPosition.futureValue);
        debtPosition.liquidityIndexAtRepayment = state.data.borrowAToken.liquidityIndex();
        state.repayDebt(params.debtPositionId, debtPosition.futureValue);

        emit Events.Repay(params.debtPositionId);
    }
}
```

The user achieves this by first depositing the required amount of underlying borrow tokens (here, USDC) and then calling the `repay(RepayParams calldata params)` function:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/DepositTokenLibrary.sol#L49>

```solidity
    function depositUnderlyingBorrowTokenToVariablePool(State storage state, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        external
    {
        state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);

        IAToken aToken =
            IAToken(state.data.variablePool.getReserveData(address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken)).aTokenAddress);

        uint256 scaledBalanceBefore = aToken.scaledBalanceOf(address(this));

        state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.forceApprove(address(state.data.variablePool), amount);
        state.data.variablePool.supply(address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken), amount, address(this), 0);

        uint256 scaledAmount = aToken.scaledBalanceOf(address(this)) - scaledBalanceBefore;

        state.data.borrowAToken.mintScaled(to, scaledAmount);
    }
```

Now, in our case, when the borrower decides to deposit `100ke6` USDC (at max if it would have some existing `borrowAToken`), he would not be able to do so (as the cap would be hit by depositing just `10e6` USDC). The situation is that the tenor is about to end (1 day left) and the borrower is not able to repay, not because he does not have money, but because `borrowAToken`'s total supply cap does not allow him to deposit enough USDC.

To mitigate this, Size provides the multicall function, that bypasses the deposit limit and allows users to carry out such actions (LOC-80 in Deposit.sol):

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Deposit.sol#L80>

```solidity
    function executeDeposit(State storage state, DepositParams calldata params) public {
        address from = msg.sender;
        uint256 amount = params.amount;
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            // do not trust msg.value (see `Multicall.sol`)
            amount = address(this).balance;
            // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth
            state.data.weth.deposit{value: amount}();
            state.data.weth.forceApprove(address(this), amount);
            from = address(this);
        }

        if (params.token == address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken)) {
            state.depositUnderlyingBorrowTokenToVariablePool(from, params.to, amount);
            // borrow aToken cap is not validated in multicall,
            //   since users must be able to deposit more tokens to repay debt
            if (!state.data.isMulticall) {
                state.validateBorrowATokenCap();
            }
        } else {
            state.depositUnderlyingCollateralToken(from, params.to, amount);
        }

        emit Events.Deposit(params.token, params.to, amount);
    }
}
```

Let's say a user uses the multicall function for a (deposit and repay) pair action. The multicall function checks for an invariant that restricts users from depositing more `borrowATokens` than required to repay the loan by restricting:

```
    increase in borrowAToken supply <= decrease in debtToken supply
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L19>

```solidity
    function validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease(
        State storage state,
        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore,
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyBefore,
        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter,
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyAfter
    ) external view {
        // If the supply is above the cap
        if (borrowATokenSupplyAfter > state.riskConfig.borrowATokenCap) {
            uint256 borrowATokenSupplyIncrease = borrowATokenSupplyAfter > borrowATokenSupplyBefore
                ? borrowATokenSupplyAfter - borrowATokenSupplyBefore
                : 0;
            uint256 debtATokenSupplyDecrease =
                debtTokenSupplyBefore > debtTokenSupplyAfter ? debtTokenSupplyBefore - debtTokenSupplyAfter : 0;

            // and the supply increase is greater than the debt reduction
            if (borrowATokenSupplyIncrease > debtATokenSupplyDecrease) {
                // revert
                revert Errors.BORROW_ATOKEN_INCREASE_EXCEEDS_DEBT_TOKEN_DECREASE(
                    borrowATokenSupplyIncrease, debtATokenSupplyDecrease
                );
            }
            // otherwise, it means the debt reduction was greater than the inflow of cash: do not revert
        }
        // otherwise, the supply is below the cap: do not revert
    }
```

The problem is, this is the exact invariant that is broken. The PoC below explains how in detail.

### Proof of Concept

I have provided a thorough step-by-step PoC to explain how the invariant is broken. Let's continue with our previous example.

Let's say the `borrowAToken` cap is `1Me6` and its current supply is `990ke6`. Before calling the multicall function, the `borrowAToken` balances are:

- borrower = 0
- Size contract = 0
- Total supply of `borrowAToken` = `990ke6`

Also, before calling the multicall function:

```
    debtToken.balanceOf[borrower] = 100ke6
```

The borrower calls the multicall function, with (deposit and repay) action pair in Size.sol:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L142>

```solidity
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata _data)
        public
        payable
        override(IMulticall)
        whenNotPaused
        returns (bytes[] memory results)
    {
        results = state.multicall(_data);
    }
```

To make things simple to understand, let's assume that this is the first repayment of a loan; that is, other credit-debt pairs exist but have sufficient time to mature.

The borrower has used the multicall to deposit `500ke6` USDC and would want to repay his debt completely (`100ke6` USDC). The deposit action would be performed (as the deposit limit check is bypassed). After the deposit is over, the `borrowAToken` balances would be:

- borrower = 500ke6 (actually, it would be ~500ke6 due to calculations involving AToken and liquidity index, but, I have used 500ke6 for simplicity).
- Size contract = 0
- Total supply of `borrowAToken` = `1.49Me6`

After the repayment is over, the borrowAToken balances are:

- borrower = `400ke6`
- Size contract = `100ke6`
- Total supply of `borrowAToken` = `1.49Me6`

Also, after repayment:

```
    debtToken.balanceOf[borrower] = 0
```

Now, the above situation breaks the invariant:

```
    increase in borrowAToken supply (= 500ke6) is not <= decrease in debtToken supply (= 100ke6)
```

The multicall flow should revert. However, if we look at the `multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data)` function in Multicall.sol:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/Multicall.sol#L26>

```solidity
    function multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data) internal returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        state.data.isMulticall = true;

        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyBefore = state.data.debtToken.totalSupply();

        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            results[i] = Address.functionDelegateCall(address(this), data[i]);
        }

        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyAfter = state.data.debtToken.totalSupply();

        state.validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease(
            borrowATokenSupplyBefore, debtTokenSupplyBefore, borrowATokenSupplyAfter, debtTokenSupplyAfter
        );

        state.data.isMulticall = false;
    }
}
```

LOC-29 sets the `borrowATokenSupplyBefore` variable to `borrowAToken.balanceOf(Size_contract)`:

```solidity
uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
```

LOC-37 sets the `borrowATokenSupplyAfter` variable to `borrowAToken.balanceOf(Size_contract)`:

```solidity
uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
```

As per our example:

```solidity
uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = 0
uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter = 100ke6
```

Now, `validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease()` is called at LOC-40:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L19>

```solidity
    function validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease(
        State storage state,
        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore,
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyBefore,
        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter,
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyAfter
    ) external view {
        // If the supply is above the cap
        if (borrowATokenSupplyAfter > state.riskConfig.borrowATokenCap) {
            uint256 borrowATokenSupplyIncrease = borrowATokenSupplyAfter > borrowATokenSupplyBefore
                ? borrowATokenSupplyAfter - borrowATokenSupplyBefore
                : 0;
            uint256 debtATokenSupplyDecrease =
                debtTokenSupplyBefore > debtTokenSupplyAfter ? debtTokenSupplyBefore - debtTokenSupplyAfter : 0;

            // and the supply increase is greater than the debt reduction
            if (borrowATokenSupplyIncrease > debtATokenSupplyDecrease) {
                // revert
                revert Errors.BORROW_ATOKEN_INCREASE_EXCEEDS_DEBT_TOKEN_DECREASE(
                    borrowATokenSupplyIncrease, debtATokenSupplyDecrease
                );
            }
            // otherwise, it means the debt reduction was greater than the inflow of cash: do not revert
        }
        // otherwise, the supply is below the cap: do not revert
    }
```

In this function, the first `if()` statement at LOC-27 would be executed, as per our example:

```
    if(100ke6 > 1Me6)
```

... which would be false.

Therefore, the control flow does not move in the `if()` block, and the protocol assumes "the supply is below the cap: do not revert". As a result, the multicall function would not revert.

The root cause of this issue is the use of `state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this))` to set variables `borrowATokenSupplyBefore` and `borrowATokenSupplyAfter`. Instead of `state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, `state.data.borrowAToken.totalSupply()` should be used. This would work as then:

```
    borrowATokenSupplyBefore would be 990ke6
    borrowATokenSupplyAfter would be 1.49Me6
```

And, in the `if()` block of `validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease()` function, we would have:

```
    if(1.49Me6 > 1Me6)
```

... which would be true. Thus, the control flow would enter into the `if()` block. At LOC-35, we would have:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L35>

```solidity
            // and the supply increase is greater than the debt reduction
            if (borrowATokenSupplyIncrease > debtATokenSupplyDecrease) {
                // revert
                revert Errors.BORROW_ATOKEN_INCREASE_EXCEEDS_DEBT_TOKEN_DECREASE(
                    borrowATokenSupplyIncrease, debtATokenSupplyDecrease
                );
            }
```

That is:

```
    if(500ke6 > 100ke6)
```

... which would be true again and finally, the transaction would revert.

This root cause gives rise to one more issue:
- A user would use the multicall for a deposit action only but would be able to bypass the deposit limit.

To comprehend this, think of a similar situation as above where:
- The cap of `borrorAToken` supply = `1Me6`
- Current total supply of `borrowAToken` = `990ke6`

Moreover, to keep things simple, let's assume that:

```
    borrowToken.balanceOf[Size_contract] = 0
```

Now, a user deposits `200ke6` USDC using the multicall function. The normal (that is, without multicall) USDC deposit flow contains a logic to check for the deposit limit, which is bypassed when a multicall is used:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Deposit.sol#L80>

```solidity
            if (!state.data.isMulticall) {
                state.validateBorrowATokenCap();
            }
```

After completing the deposit, the multicall function would call the `validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease()` function for a check (similar to above). The following arguments would have the specified value:

```
            uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = borrowToken.balanceOf[Size_contract] = 0
            uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter = borrowToken.balanceOf[Size_contract] = 0
```

Now, again in the `if()` block at LOC-27:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L27>

```solidity
        if (borrowATokenSupplyAfter > state.riskConfig.borrowATokenCap)
```

We would have the following:

```
    if(0 > 1Me6)
```

... which would be false, and, so, the control flow would not enter the `if()` block. Thus, the multicall flow would pass with the following result:

- Current total supply of `borrowAToken` = `1.19Me6`
- The cap of total supply of `borrowAToken` = `1Me6`

The user was successful in depositing USDC in spite of the fact that his deposit crossed the deposit limit.

### Severity

- **Impact:** An invariant, which should not break, is broken. This point sets the impact of this issue to be Medium.
- **Likelihood:** Any user would call the Multicall function (since it is not access-controlled) and can bypass the deposit limit as well as the restriction: increase in `borrowAToken` supply `<=` decrease in `debtToken` supply. This makes the likelihood high.

The final severity comes to be Medium. Moreover, the multicall functionality does not work as intended, affecting the availability of the correct intended version of multicall.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Apply the following in `multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data)` function:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/Multicall.sol#L26>

```diff
    function multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data) internal returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        state.data.isMulticall = true;

-       uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+       uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.totalSupply();
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyBefore = state.data.debtToken.totalSupply();

        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            results[i] = Address.functionDelegateCall(address(this), data[i]);
        }

-       uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+       uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore = state.data.borrowAToken.totalSupply();
        uint256 debtTokenSupplyAfter = state.data.debtToken.totalSupply();

        state.validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease(
            borrowATokenSupplyBefore, debtTokenSupplyBefore, borrowATokenSupplyAfter, debtTokenSupplyAfter
        );

        state.data.isMulticall = false;
    }
}
```

### Impact

The minimum credit user can buy or sell can be gotten from `state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken` which was set as `5e6`. However, in `buyCreditMarket` and `sellCreditMarket` user can not buy or sell minimun credit allowed or small amount above it due to the `exactAmountIn` condition he chose.

**In `buyCreditMarket`:** when user set `params.exactAmountIn = true`, The `params.amount` value will be cash he want to use to buy credit. Since the `params.amount` value is cash it can be set less than `state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken` (5e6) as long as when the value get converted to credit it will reach the `state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken` value. But, unfortunately, in `validateBuyCreditMarket()` whenever `params.amount` is less than `state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken` the transaction will revert due to below code present in the function.

```javascript
if (params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) {
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
}
```

For example, the cash user can use to buy minimum credit allowed (`5e6`) can be calculated as in the code below, And the value should be less than the minimum credit allowed (`5e6`).

```javascript
uint256 minimumCash = Math.mulDivUp(5e6, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor);
```

**In `sellCreditMarket`:** when user set `params.exactAmountIn = false`, The `params.amount` will be the exact cash he want to receive. But he will also not be able to set the `params.amount` value to be less than `state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken` value due to the below code present in `validateSellCreditMarket()`.

    if (params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) {
        revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
    }

### Proof of Concept

**For `BuyCreditMarket`:** Copy and paste below code in `/test/local/actions/BuyCreditMarket.t.sol`:

```javascript
function testFail_UserCanNotBuyMinimumCredit() public {
    // alice deposit weth
    _deposit(alice, weth, 100e18);

    // bob deposit usdc
    _deposit(bob, usdc, 200e6);

    // alice create a borrow offer
    _sellCreditLimit(alice, 0.03e18, 365 days);

    // calculate cash from minimum  credit borrowAToken allowed = 5e6
    uint256 minimumCash = Math.mulDivUp(5e6, PERCENT, PERCENT + 0.03e18);

    // Expect revert with an error CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT
    uint256 debtPositionId = _buyCreditMarket(bob, alice, minimumCash, 365 days, true);
}
```

Then run the test with below command, the test should pass because it will revert with an error `Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT`.

```
forge test --mt testFail_UserCanNotBuyMinimumCredit
```

**For `SellCreditMarket`:** Copy and paste below code in `/test/local/actions/SellCreditMarket.t.sol`:

```javascript
function testFail_UserCanNotSellMinimumCredit() public {
    // alice deposit usdc
    _deposit(alice, usdc, 200e6);

    // bob deposit weth
    _deposit(bob, weth, 100e18);

    // alice create a loan offer
    _buyCreditLimit(alice, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(365 days, 0.03e18));

    // calculate cash from minimum  credit borrowAToken allowed = 5e6
    uint256 minimumCreditInCash = Math.mulDivUp(5e6, PERCENT, PERCENT + 0.03e18);

    // Expect revert with an error CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT
    uint256 debtPositionId = _sellCreditMarket(bob, alice, RESERVED_ID, minimumCreditInCash, 365 days, false);
}
```

Then run the test with below command, the test should pass because it will revert with an error `Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT`.

```
forge test --mt testFail_UserCanNotSellMinimumCredit
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `validateBuyCreditMarket()` and  `validateSellCreditMarket()` for `BuyCreditMarket` and `SellCreditMarket` libraries respectively, there is a need of considering the condition of `params.exactAmountIn` value. The check should be implemented as shown below.

**For `BuyCreditMarket` library:** inside `validateBuyCreditMarket()` replace below code:

```javascript
if (params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) { // @audit 5e6 USDC
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
}
```

With the below code:

```javascript
uint256 ratePerTenor = borrowOffer.getRatePerTenor(VariablePoolBorrowRateParams({variablePoolBorrowRate: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRate, variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt, variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval}), tenor);

if (params.exactAmountIn && params.amount < Math.mulDivUp(state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor)) {
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
} else if (!params.exactAmountIn && params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) {
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
}
```

**For `SellCreditMarket` library:** inside `validateSellCreditMarket()` replace below code:

```javascript
if (params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) { // @audit 5e6 USDC
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
}
```

With the below code:

```javascript
uint256 ratePerTenor = loanOffer.getRatePerTenor(VariablePoolBorrowRateParams({variablePoolBorrowRate: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRate, variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateUpdatedAt, variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval: state.oracle.variablePoolBorrowRateStaleRateInterval}), tenor);

if (params.exactAmountIn && params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) {
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
} else if (!params.exactAmountIn && params.amount < Math.mulDivUp(state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor)) {
    revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
}
```

Size queries the `underlyingBorrowToken` balance of the `variablePool` during borrowing and lending actions in order to check available liquidity. If there is not enough available liquidity for the new borrower to withdraw the borrowed assets, the function call will revert:

[Size::buyCreditMarket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L178-L185)

```solidity
178:    function buyCreditMarket(BuyCreditMarketParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
...
184:        state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount); // @audit: liquidity check
```

[Size::sellCreditMarket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L188-L194)

```solidity
188:    function sellCreditMarket(SellCreditMarketParams memory params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
...
194:        state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount); // @audit: liquidity check
```

[CapsLibrary::validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L67-L71)

```solidity
67:    function validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(State storage state, uint256 amount) public view {
68:        uint256 liquidity = state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.balanceOf(address(state.data.variablePool)); // @audit: ATokens hold liquidity, not variablePool
69:        if (liquidity < amount) {
70:            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_BORROW_ATOKEN_LIQUIDITY(liquidity, amount);
71:        }
```

However, [Aave actual holds all liquidity in the `AToken` contracts](https://app.aave.com/markets/), not the `Pool` contracts. Therefore, the liquidity check above will always fail when the `variablePool` references a live instance of an actual Aave Pool. This is due to the fact that the `variablePool` balance will be 0 (does not hold any liquidity), causing borrowing and lending actions to revert on line 70 in `CapsLibrary.sol`.

The below code snippets are taken from out of scope contracts, but are shown to further explain why the test suite did not detect this vulnerability:

[SupplyLogic::executeSupply](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L52-L67)

```solidity
52:  function executeSupply(
...
67:    IERC20(params.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, reserveCache.aTokenAddress, params.amount);
```

As shown above, the actual implementation of the Aave pool will transfer supplied assets to the `aTokenAddress` on supplies. The Aave pool implementation will then transfer the assets from the AToken to the recipient during withdraws, since the liquidity is stored in the AToken contract:

[SupplyLogic::executeWithdraw](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L106-L144)

```solidity
106:  function executeWithdraw(
...
139:    IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).burn(
140:      msg.sender,
141:      params.to,
142:      amountToWithdraw,
143:      reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
144:    );
```

[AToken::burn](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/tokenization/AToken.sol#L96-L104)

```solidity
96:   function burn(
97:     address from,
98:     address receiverOfUnderlying,
99:     uint256 amount,
100:    uint256 index
101:  ) external virtual override onlyPool {
102:    _burnScaled(from, receiverOfUnderlying, amount, index);
103:    if (receiverOfUnderlying != address(this)) {
104:      IERC20(_underlyingAsset).safeTransfer(receiverOfUnderlying, amount);
```

However, Size uses a `PoolMock` contract for their test suite, which implements logic that differs from actual Aave Pool contracts:

[PoolMock.sol#L67-L78](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/test/mocks/PoolMock.sol#L67-L78)

```solidity
67:    function supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16) external {
68:        Data memory data = datas[asset];
69:        IERC20Metadata(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // @audit: underlying transferred from supplier to PoolMock contract
70:        data.aToken.mint(address(this), onBehalfOf, amount, data.reserveIndex);
71:    }
72:
73:    function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) external returns (uint256) {
74:        Data memory data = datas[asset];
75:        data.aToken.burn(msg.sender, address(data.aToken), amount, data.reserveIndex); // @audit: no assets transferred from AToken
76:        IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransfer(to, amount); // @audit: underlying transferred from PoolMock contract to supplier
77:        return amount;
78:    }
```

As shown above, the `PoolMock` contract transfers all supplied assets to the `PoolMock` contract itself, not the AToken contract. This differs from how actual Aave Pools handle liquidity on live networks.

### Impact

Borrow (`sellCreditMarket`) and lend (`buyCreditMarket`) operations will be bricked when Size is deployed and integrates with Aave on a live network. This report is labeled as High due to the fact that the main functionalities of this lending protocol will be unusable upon deployment.

### Proof of Concept

The following PoC simply showcases the fact that the `AToken` does not hold the liquidity in the test suite. See [here](https://app.aave.com/markets/) to observe that `ATokens` are the contracts that hold liquidity for Aave in live networks.

## [[M-04] Inadequate checks to confirm the correct status of the sequence/`sequencerUptimeFeed` in `PriceFeed.getPrice()` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/209)
*Submitted by [adeolu](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/209), also found by [serial-coder](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/414)*

The `PriceFeed` contract has `sequencerUptimeFeed` checks in place to assert if the sequencer on an L2 is running but these checks are not implemented correctly. The [chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) say that `sequencerUptimeFeed` can return a 0 value for `startedAt` if it is called during an "invalid round".

> **startedAt:** This timestamp indicates when the sequencer changed status. This timestamp returns 0 if a round is invalid. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract startedAt from block.timestamp and revert the request if the result is less than the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME`.
> 
> If the sequencer is up and the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` has passed, the function retrieves the latest answer from the data feed using the `dataFeed` object.

Please note that an **"invalid round"** is described to mean there was a problem updating the sequencer's status, possibly due to network issues or problems with data from oracles, and is shown by a `startedAt` time of 0 and `answer` is 0. Further explanation can be seen as given by an official chainlink engineer as seen here in the chainlink public discord

*Note: to view the provided image, please see the original submission [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/209).*

This makes the implemented check below in the [PriceFeed.getPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol#L63C1-L82C6) to be useless if its called in an invalid round.

```solidity
            if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) { 
                revert Errors.GRACE_PERIOD_NOT_OVER();
            }
```

As `startedAt` will be 0, the arithmetic operation `block.timestamp - startedAt` will result in a value greater than `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` (which is hardcoded to be 3600). I.e., `block.timestamp = 1719739032`, so 1719739032 - 0 = 1719739032 which is bigger than 3600. The code won't revert.

Imagine a case where a round starts, at the beginning `startedAt` is recorded to be 0, and `answer`, the initial status is set to be 0. Note that docs say that if `answer` = 0, sequencer is up, if equals to 1, sequencer is down. But in this case here, `answer` and `startedAt` can be 0 initially, until after all data is gotten from oracles and update is confirmed then the values are reset to the correct values that show the correct status of the sequencer.

From these explanations and information, it can be seen that `startedAt` value is a second value that should be used in the check for if a sequencer is down/up or correctly updated. The checks in [`PriceFeed.getPrice()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol#L63C1-L82C6) will allow for successfull calls in an invalid round because reverts don't happen if `answer == 0` and `startedAt == 0` thus defeating the purpose of having a `sequencerFeed` check to ascertain the status of the `sequencerFeed` on L2 (i.e., if it is up/down/active or if its status is actually confirmed to be either).

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol#L68C1-L76C14>

```solidity
            if (answer == 1) {
                // sequencer is down
                revert Errors.SEQUENCER_DOWN();
            }

            if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
                // time since up
                revert Errors.GRACE_PERIOD_NOT_OVER();
            }
```

### Impact

Inadequate checks to confirm the correct status of the sequencer/`sequencerUptimeFeed` in `PriceFeed.getPrice()` contract will cause `getPrice()` to not revert even when the sequencer uptime feed is not updated or is called in an invalid round.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check that reverts if `startedAt` is returned as 0.

## [[M-05] Users may incur an unexpected fragmentation fee in the `compensate()`  call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/197)
*Submitted by [mt030d](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/197), also found by [pkqs90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/63)*

### Impact

The `CompensateParams` struct lacks a field indicating the minimum amount the user is willing to compensate in the `compensate()` call. Consequently, users might pay an unexpected fragmentation fee during the `compensate()` call.

In scenarios where a borrower has a credit position that can be used to compensate the debt (`creditPositionToCompensateId`), they could search the market for a credit position (`creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId`) that relates to the debt and has the same credit amount as `creditPositionToCompensateId`. This way, in the `compensate()` call, the borrower would not fragment the `creditPositionToCompensateId` and avoid paying the fragmentation fee.

However, unexpectedly to the borrower, they might still pay the fragmentation fee if the `compensate()` transaction is executed after a `buyCreditMarket()` or `sellCreditMarket()` transaction that decreases the credit in `creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId`.

```
            uint256 amountToCompensate = Math.min(params.amount, creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit);
```

```

            uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;
```

```

            if (exiterCreditRemaining > 0) {
                // charge the fragmentation fee in collateral tokens, capped by the user balance
                uint256 fragmentationFeeInCollateral = Math.min(
                    state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee),
                    state.data.collateralToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)
                );
                state.data.collateralToken.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fragmentationFeeInCollateral
                );
            }
```

In this case, the `amountToCompensate` will be less than the credit in `creditPositionToCompensateId`, and the user will have to pay an unforeseen fragmentation fee.

This situation can occur in normal user flows. Moreover, a malicious user could exploit this vulnerability and front-running a borrower's `compensate()` transaction to cause the borrower to pay an unforeseen fragmentation fee.

        }

        vm.revertTo(snapshot);
        _sellCreditLimit(bob, 0.04e18, 365 days);
        _buyCreditMarket(james, creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, 50e6, false);
        {
            uint256 beforeBalance = collateralToken.balanceOf(alice);
            _compensate(alice, creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, creditPositionToCompensateId);
            uint256 afterBalance = collateralToken.balanceOf(alice);
            console.log("Scenario 2: unexpected - a buyCreditMarket call executed before the compensate call");
            console.log("  fragmentation fee: %s", beforeBalance - afterBalance);
        }
    }
}
```

Run the above code with command `forge test --mc PoC -vv`, the result is as follows:

```
    Logs:
      Scenario 1: borrower's expected compensate call
        fragmentation fee: 0
      Scenario 2: unexpected - a buyCreditMarket call executed before the compensate call
        fragmentation fee: 3739715781600599
```

As show by the PoC, by the time the `compensate` transaction is executed in scenario 2, the credit in `creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId` has decreased due to an earlier `buyCreditMaket` transaction. As a result, the borrower pays an unforeseen fragmentation fee.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow the user to input a `minAmount` parameter in the `compensate()` function to specify the minimum amount they are willing to use. Then, handle this parameter within the `compensate()` function.

That's kind of minor since no attack that benefits anybody, but the protocol, can be run here so up to you.

### Impact

A credit buyer could be forced to buy a `not for sale` credit position with no way to sell it passively, potentially suffering a loss due to missing an arbitrage opportunity.

### Proof of Concept

Any user is allowed to lend or borrow `szaUSDC` through `Size` protocol.

- A borrower can create a limit borrowing order by calling `sellCreditLimit()`, anyone can lend their `szaUSDC` to this borrower by calling `buyCreditMarket()`.
- A lender can create a limit lending order by calling `buyCreditLimit()`, anyone can borrow `szaUSDC` from this lender by calling `sellCreditMarket()`.
- A existing credit position can be sold by its owner by `sellCreditMarket()` by default.
- A existing credit position by default could be bought by another borrower as long as the owner of credit position has created a limit borrowing order.

A lender can set their `allCreditPositionsForSaleDisabled` to `true`, which prevents any of their credit positions from being sold. Alternatively, a specific credit position can be marked as `not for sale`, making it impossible to sell and for anyone to buy it.

While no one can buy a `not for sale` credit position, their owner can force to sell it or use it compensate their debt. Once sold, no one can buy it again due to its `not for sale` status, resulting the new owner potentially suffering a loss.

As we can see, as a speculator, Candy might suffer a loss because the credit position she is forced to buy is not able to be bought from her by any other buyer.

## [[M-07] Credit can be sold forcibly as `forSale` setting can be ignored via Compensate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/179)
*Submitted by [hyh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/179), also found by [0xAlix2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/405), [almurhasan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/377), [BenRai](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/337), [0xStalin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/336), and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/82)*

Any credit position can be forcibly sold with the help of its borrower. This will be executed only when have expected profit; for example, when lender's curve is not null and is above the market it is profitable to buy credit from them (lend to them at above market rates), but they might block it with the lack of free collateral and the `forSale = false` flag, which can be overridden by the corresponding borrower of this credit position. The impact of this forced sale is proportional to interest rate volatility and can be substantial. There are no additional prerequisites for the setup.

### Proof of Concept

`createDebtAndCreditPositions` creates credit positions with `forSale == true`:

[AccountingLibrary.sol#L62-L82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L62-L82)

```solidity
    function createDebtAndCreditPositions(
        ...
    ) external returns (CreditPosition memory creditPosition) {
        DebtPosition memory debtPosition =
            DebtPosition({borrower: borrower, futureValue: futureValue, dueDate: dueDate, liquidityIndexAtRepayment: 0});

        uint256 debtPositionId = state.data.nextDebtPositionId++;
        state.data.debtPositions[debtPositionId] = debtPosition;

        emit Events.CreateDebtPosition(debtPositionId, borrower, lender, futureValue, dueDate);

        creditPosition = CreditPosition({
            lender: lender,
            credit: debtPosition.futureValue,
            debtPositionId: debtPositionId,
>>          forSale: true
        });

This can be done on demand for any credit position by the borrower of the corresponding debt position, by running Compensate with `params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID`, which will create new position with `forSale == true` and substitute the existing lender position with it:

[Compensate.sol#L118-L145](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L118-L145)

```solidity
        CreditPosition memory creditPositionToCompensate;
        if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
>>          creditPositionToCompensate = state.createDebtAndCreditPositions({  // @audit create new credit with `forSale == true`
                lender: msg.sender,
                borrower: msg.sender,
                futureValue: amountToCompensate,
                dueDate: debtPositionToRepay.dueDate
            });
        } else {
            creditPositionToCompensate = state.getCreditPosition(params.creditPositionToCompensateId);
            amountToCompensate = Math.min(amountToCompensate, creditPositionToCompensate.credit);
        }

        // debt and credit reduction
        state.reduceDebtAndCredit(
            creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.debtPositionId, params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, amountToCompensate
        );

        uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;

        // credit emission
>>      state.createCreditPosition({
            exitCreditPositionId: params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID  // @audit give it to the lender instead of the existing position with `forSale == false`
                ? state.data.nextCreditPositionId - 1
                : params.creditPositionToCompensateId,
            lender: creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.lender,
            credit: amountToCompensate
        });
```

Then, it can be then bought with `BuyCreditMarket`:

[BuyCreditMarket.sol#L79-L8](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/BuyCreditMarket.sol#L79-L83)

```solidity
            borrower = creditPosition.lender;
            tenor = debtPosition.dueDate - block.timestamp; // positive since the credit position is transferrable, so the loan must be ACTIVE
        }

        BorrowOffer memory borrowOffer = state.data.users[borrower].borrowOffer;
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider passing the flag to `createDebtAndCreditPositions()` indicating `forSale` flag to be set, which be passed from the existing credit in [Compensate.sol#L139](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L139), so it won't be changed.

## [[M-08] Sandwich attack on loan fulfillment will temporarily prevent users from accessing their borrowed funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/152)
*Submitted by [gesha17](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/152), also found by [grearlake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/274), [samuraii77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/225), [mt030d](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/198), [KupiaSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/142), and [VAD37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/36)*

The protocol does not remove borrowed token liquidity from the aave pool once a loan is initiated. It only checks if there is enough available liquidity via the `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity()` function. A user is expected to withdraw their funds after the loan is created. This means that a malicious user can sandwich loans that exceed the available liquidity in aave by depositing liquidity in a frontrun transaction and removing it in a backrun transaction. This way a user that takes out a loan will not be able to remove their funds until there is enough available liquidity in the pool.

Also note that liquidity may become unavailable via other factors, like external users removing liquidity from aave.

### Proof of Concept

The `sellCreditMarket()` function does not remove liquidity from aave, but only checks if there is enough liquidity available via a call to `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity()`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L194>

```js
    function sellCreditMarket(SellCreditMarketParams memory params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
        state.validateSellCreditMarket(params);
        uint256 amount = state.executeSellCreditMarket(params);
        if (params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID) {
            state.validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR(msg.sender);
        }
        // @audit validate liquidity after execution??
        state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount);
    }
```

Also, the `executeSellCreditMarket()` function transfers the size protocol accounting `borrowAToken` to the borrower, instead of the underlying token itself, leaving the user to withdraw their borrowed funds in a separate transaction.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L202>

```js
    function validateSellCreditMarket(State storage state, SellCreditMarketParams calldata params) external view {
        ...
        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(params.lender, msg.sender, cashAmountOut);
        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(params.lender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fees);
    }
```

The `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity()` function only checks the balance of the variable pool, and does not remove liquidity:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L67>

```js
    function validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(State storage state, uint256 amount) public view {
        uint256 liquidity = state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.balanceOf(address(state.data.variablePool));
        if (liquidity < amount) {
            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_BORROW_ATOKEN_LIQUIDITY(liquidity, amount);
        }
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the liquidity from the pool when the loan is created and still let the user pull their funds in a separate transaction to remain compliant with pull over push pattern.

## [[M-09] Borrower is not able to compensate his lenders if he is underwater](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/107)
*Submitted by [ilchovski](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/107), also found by [0xAlix2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/434), [alix40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/363), [dhank](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/309), [zzebra83](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/292), [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/78), and [pkqs90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/58)*

A borrower of a loan could have other credit positions with borrowers that have healthy CRs which he could use to compensate his lenders to avoid liquidations and improve his CR. However, he is not able to do this via [`compensate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L247) and he is forced to sell his credit positions via [`sellCreditMarket()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L188) or [`sellCreditLimit()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L172). The complications of this are described in the example below.

### Proof of Concept

Before we start just to have context, [`repay()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L198) repays the whole debt amount of the loan in full and can be called even when the borrower is underwater or past due date.

[`compensate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L247) is used to either split a loan in smaller parts in order to be more easily repaid with [`repay()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L198) or to repay certain lenders and reduce the debt of the loan by the borrower giving specific lenders some of his own healthy credit positions that he owns.

Here is an example of the issue:
Bob has collateral X in place and has 10 different debt positions (he borrowed).
With the newly acquired borrow tokens he buys 10 different credit positions.

Some time passes and his collateral value drops significantly (volatile market), his CR is below the healthy threshold. At the moment Bob does not have any more borrow tokens available but he has 10 healthy credit positions that he can use to improve his CR by compensating some of his lenders.

Here comes the important part: He can successfully compensate 1 of his lenders if at the end of the [`compensate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L247) tx his CR becomes healthy. The problem appears when he must compensate for 3 out of all 10 debt positions (more than 1 position) in order to become with healthy CR.

He will call compensate for the first time and the end of this tx he will face a revert due to this check because he needs to compensate 2 more times to become healthy.

```solidity
    function compensate(CompensateParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
        state.validateCompensate(params);
        state.executeCompensate(params);
@>      state.validateUserIsNotUnderwater(msg.sender);
    }
```

[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/RiskLibrary.sol#L117-L133)

```solidity
    function isUserUnderwater(State storage state, address account) public view returns (bool) {
@>      return collateralRatio(state, account) < state.riskConfig.crLiquidation;
    }

    function validateUserIsNotUnderwater(State storage state, address account) external view {
@>      if (isUserUnderwater(state, account)) {
            revert Errors.USER_IS_UNDERWATER(account, collateralRatio(state, account));
        }
    }
```

The only option Bob has currently is to sell some of his credit positions via `sellCreditMarket` or `sellCreditLimit`. There might not be any buyers at the moment or he might be forced to take a very bad deal for his credit positions because he will be in a rush in order to repay part of his loans on time to not get liquidated.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The CR check at the end of compensate is important because fragmentation fees could occur and lower the CR and make it under the healthy threshold in some specific situations.

What I propose as a solution is measuring the CR before and after the [`compensate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/Size.sol#L247) logic and it should revert if the CR is becoming worse.

This way Bob will be able to improve his CR by using his credit positions even if he has to compensate multiple times before becoming healthy again.

## [[M-10] `withdraw()` users may can't withdraw `underlyingBorrowToken` properly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/88)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/88), also found by [0xAlix2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/433), [3n0ch](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/432), [samuraii77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/430), [ayden](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/429), [inzinko](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/428), [zarkk01](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/427), [elhaj](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/426), [Bob](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/425), [alix40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/415), and [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/99)*

We can withdraw `underlyingCollateralToken` and `underlyingBorrowToken` by `withdraw()`:

```solidity
    function withdraw(WithdrawParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
        state.validateWithdraw(params);
        state.executeWithdraw(params);
@>      state.validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR(msg.sender);
    }

    function executeWithdraw(State storage state, WithdrawParams calldata params) public {
        uint256 amount;
        if (params.token == address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken)) {
            amount = Math.min(params.amount, state.data.borrowAToken.balanceOf(msg.sender));
            if (amount > 0) {
@>              state.withdrawUnderlyingTokenFromVariablePool(msg.sender, params.to, amount);
            }
        } else {
            amount = Math.min(params.amount, state.data.collateralToken.balanceOf(msg.sender));
            if (amount > 0) {
                state.withdrawUnderlyingCollateralToken(msg.sender, params.to, amount);
            }
        }

        emit Events.Withdraw(params.token, params.to, amount);
    }
```

From the code above we know that whether we take `underlyingCollateralToken` or `underlyingBorrowToken`
will check `validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR()` `==>` `collateralRatio() > openingLimitBorrowCR`.

This makes sense for taking `underlyingCollateralToken`, but not for taking `underlyingBorrowToken`.

1. Taking the `underlyingBorrowToken` does not affect the `collateralRatio`.
2. The user has already borrowed the funds (with interest accrued and collateralized), it is the user's asset, and should be able to be withdrawn at will, even if it may be liquidated.
3. `openingLimitBorrowCR` is still far from being liquidated, and should not restrict the user from withdrawing the borrowed token.

### Impact

If the token is already borrowed, just stored in `Size` and not yet taken, but due to a slight price fluctuation, `validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR()` fails but is still far from being liquidated, the user may not be able to take the borrowed token, resulting in the possibility that the user may not be able to withdraw the borrowed funds.

### Recommended Mitigation

```diff
    function withdraw(WithdrawParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
        state.validateWithdraw(params);
        state.executeWithdraw(params);
+       if (params.token != address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken)  {
+             state.validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR(msg.sender);
+       }
    }
```

## [[M-11] `LiquidateWithReplacement` does not charge swap fees on the borrower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/53)

When a user places a credit sell limit order, it may be either:
1. Bought by other users.
2. Bought by the `LiquidateWithReplacement` action.

However, for case number 2, it does not charge a swap fee for the borrower, which contradicts to the swap fee definition.

### Bug Description

Let's first see how `LiquidateWithReplacement` works. There are two steps:

1. Liquidation: Liquidator sends the amount of debt `debt.futureValue` to the protocol, and receive collateral tokens as liquidation reward.
2. Buy credit: Use the original lender's `debt.futureValue` as credit to buy credit from the borrower. This way the original lender can still get the same amount of credit at the same `dueDate`. The liquidator can then take away the difference between `debt.futureValue` and the amount sent to the borrower.

Note that step 2 is the same as buying credit using the `BuyCreditMarket` function.

However, according to the [docs](https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/governance-variables-and-fees#governance-variables-work-in-progress), all cash and credit swaps should charge swap fees on the borrower. The issue here is the swap in `LiquidateWithReplacement` does not charge swap fees.

> Protocol fee; charged to the recipient of USDC on `cash->credit` and `credit->cash` swaps. Prorated based on credit tenor (the fee is annualized).

    }
```

### Proof of Concept

Say two users setup the same sell limit order.

The first user's order was bought by a user via `BuyCreditMarket`, and the second user's order was bought by `LiquidateWithReplacement`. However, the swap fee is only charged to the first user. This is unfair and is not mentioned anywhere expected in the documents.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Also charge swap fees during `executeLiquidateWithReplacement`.

*Submitted by [said](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/15), also found by [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/424), [zhaojohnson](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/420), [Honour](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/372), [samuraii77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/345), [inzinko](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/318), [trachev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/264), [alix40](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/240), [hyh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/170), and [KupiaSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/143)*

When `executeBuyCreditMarket` is called and returns the cash amount, it will return the cash amount without deducting the fee. This results in overestimating the value that needs to be validated by `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity`.

### Proof of Concept

When `executeBuyCreditMarket` is called, it will transfer `cashAmountIn - fees` to the borrower. This means the amount that needs to be available for withdrawal in the variable pool is `cashAmountIn - fees`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/BuyCreditMarket.sol#L195>

```solidity
    function executeBuyCreditMarket(State storage state, BuyCreditMarketParams memory params)
        external
>>>     returns (uint256 cashAmountIn)
    {
        // ...

        uint256 creditAmountOut;
        uint256 fees;

        if (params.exactAmountIn) {
            cashAmountIn = params.amount;
            (creditAmountOut, fees) = state.getCreditAmountOut({
                cashAmountIn: cashAmountIn,
                maxCashAmountIn: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID
                    ? cashAmountIn
                    : Math.mulDivUp(creditPosition.credit, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor),
                maxCredit: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID
                    ? Math.mulDivDown(cashAmountIn, PERCENT + ratePerTenor, PERCENT)
                    : creditPosition.credit,
                ratePerTenor: ratePerTenor,
                tenor: tenor
            });
        } else {
            creditAmountOut = params.amount;
            (cashAmountIn, fees) = state.getCashAmountIn({
                creditAmountOut: creditAmountOut,
                maxCredit: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID ? creditAmountOut : creditPosition.credit,
                ratePerTenor: ratePerTenor,
                tenor: tenor
            });
        }

       // ...

>>>     state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, borrower, cashAmountIn - fees);
        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fees);
    }
```

However, `executeBuyCreditMarket` will return `cashAmountIn`, and provide it to `validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity` and check if the variable pool have `cashAmountIn` amount of token.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L178-L185>

```solidity
    function buyCreditMarket(BuyCreditMarketParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
        state.validateBuyCreditMarket(params);
>>>     uint256 amount = state.executeBuyCreditMarket(params);
        if (params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID) {
            state.validateUserIsNotBelowOpeningLimitBorrowCR(params.borrower);
        }
>>>     state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount);
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L67-L72>

```solidity
    function validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(State storage state, uint256 amount) public view {
        uint256 liquidity = state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.balanceOf(address(state.data.variablePool));
        if (liquidity < amount) {
            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_BORROW_ATOKEN_LIQUIDITY(liquidity, amount);
        }
    }
```

This will overestimate the amount of liquidity that needs to be available in the variable pool and could cause the call to unnecessarily revert.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the returned `cashAmountIn` to `cashAmountIn - fees` at the end of `executeBuyCreditMarket`.

```diff
    function executeBuyCreditMarket(State storage state, BuyCreditMarketParams memory params)
        external
>>>     returns (uint256 cashAmountIn)
    {
        // ...

        uint256 creditAmountOut;
        uint256 fees;

        if (params.exactAmountIn) {
            cashAmountIn = params.amount;
            (creditAmountOut, fees) = state.getCreditAmountOut({
                cashAmountIn: cashAmountIn,
                maxCashAmountIn: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID
                    ? cashAmountIn
                    : Math.mulDivUp(creditPosition.credit, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor),
                maxCredit: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID
                    ? Math.mulDivDown(cashAmountIn, PERCENT + ratePerTenor, PERCENT)
                    : creditPosition.credit,
                ratePerTenor: ratePerTenor,
                tenor: tenor
            });
        } else {
            creditAmountOut = params.amount;
            (cashAmountIn, fees) = state.getCashAmountIn({
                creditAmountOut: creditAmountOut,
                maxCredit: params.creditPositionId == RESERVED_ID ? creditAmountOut : creditPosition.credit,
                ratePerTenor: ratePerTenor,
                tenor: tenor
            });
        }

       // ...

        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, borrower, cashAmountIn - fees);
        state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fees);
+       cashAmountIn = cashAmountIn - fees;     
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L119-L125><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L136>

### Impact

User can split his debt credit using the `compensate` function without paying the fragmentation fee.

### Proof of Concept

The fragmentation fee normally applies when the initial credit amount is split, creating a new credit position with the fractionalized amount. However, under specific conditions when the `compensate` function is invoked, this fee is not charged.

Consider the following scenario, the user compensates half of his debt (`amountToCompensate = creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit / 2`) with a new credit position (`params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID`) to the lender:

```solidity
    function executeCompensate(State storage state, CompensateParams calldata params) external {
        emit Events.Compensate(
            params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, params.creditPositionToCompensateId, params.amount
        );

        CreditPosition storage creditPositionWithDebtToRepay =
            state.getCreditPosition(params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId);
        DebtPosition storage debtPositionToRepay =
            state.getDebtPositionByCreditPositionId(params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId);

>>      uint256 amountToCompensate = Math.min(params.amount, creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit);

        CreditPosition memory creditPositionToCompensate;
        if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
>>          creditPositionToCompensate = state.createDebtAndCreditPositions({
                lender: msg.sender,
                borrower: msg.sender,
                futureValue: amountToCompensate,
                dueDate: debtPositionToRepay.dueDate
            });

        ---SNIP---
```

In the above code snippet, a new credit position is created with `credit = futureValue = amountToCompensate`. This results in `creditPositionToCompensate.credit` always equating to `amountToCompensate`, leading `exiterCreditRemaining` to consistently be zero:

```solidity
        ---SNIP---

>>      uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;

        // credit emission
        state.createCreditPosition({
            exitCreditPositionId: params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID
                ? state.data.nextCreditPositionId - 1
                : params.creditPositionToCompensateId,
            lender: creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.lender,
            credit: amountToCompensate
        });
>>      if (exiterCreditRemaining > 0) {
            // charge the fragmentation fee in collateral tokens, capped by the user balance
            uint256 fragmentationFeeInCollateral = Math.min(
                state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee),
                state.data.collateralToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)
            );
            state.data.collateralToken.transferFrom(
                msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fragmentationFeeInCollateral
            );
```

As a result, despite splitting `creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit` in half and creating a new credit position, the fragmentation fee is not deducted as expected.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```diff
+  uint256 initialCredit = params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID
     ?  creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit
     :  creditPositionToCompensate.credit;
+  uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = initialCredit - amountToCompensate;
```

## [L-01] There should be a grace period for repayment

Debt positions have a due date and can be liquidated after this date. 
Many users will try to repay their debts before the due date. 
For example, some users may start repaying one day or one hour in advance, depending on their preference. 
However, there is no 100% guarantee that these repayments will be executed within this period. 
If the repayment transaction is not included in the block, the debt position might be accidentally liquidated.

At this point, anyone can easily profit by liquidating this debt position.
Therefore, it is sensible to set a grace period during which liquidation is not allowed. 
This can help prevent accidental liquidation and protect users' funds.

This issue can be upgraded as it results in users' funds loss.

## [L-02] Lenders can potentially lose funds in the `buyCreditMarket` function

In the `buyCreditMarket` function, let's denote some values:
- `A` is the future `credit` value that the `lender` will receive.
- `V` is the `cash` amount that the `lender` should pay to the `borrower`.
- `k` is the `swap fee`.
- `T` is the `tenor`.
- `r` is the rate.

According to the formula described in the documentation, when the fragmentation fee is 0, the relationship between these values is as follows:

```
A=VÃ—(1+r)
fee=VÃ—kÃ—T
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L285-L286

```
function getCreditAmountOut(
    State storage state,
    uint256 cashAmountIn,
    uint256 maxCashAmountIn,
    uint256 maxCredit,
    uint256 ratePerTenor,
    uint256 tenor
) internal view returns (uint256 creditAmountOut, uint256 fees) {
    if (cashAmountIn == maxCashAmountIn) {
        creditAmountOut = maxCredit;
        fees = getSwapFee(state, cashAmountIn, tenor);
    } else if (cashAmountIn < maxCashAmountIn) {
        ...
    } else {
        revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_CREDIT(maxCashAmountIn, cashAmountIn);
    }
}
```

There is no guarantee that `A` is always larger than the sum of `V+fee` due to the absence of a strict relation between `k` and `r`. Therefore, `lenders` can potentially pay more funds than what they will receive in the future.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/BuyCreditMarket.sol#L195-L196

```
function executeBuyCreditMarket(State storage state, BuyCreditMarketParams memory params)
    external
    returns (uint256 cashAmountIn)
{
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, borrower, cashAmountIn - fees);
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fees);
}
```

The loss can increase when there is a fragmentation fee. This issue can be upgraded as it can lead to a user's funds loss.

## [L-03] Users who have a `loan offer` should have some `USDC` to create a `loan`.

In the `sellCreditMarket` function, the transaction will be reverted if the lender does not have enough USDC. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L201-L202

```
function executeSellCreditMarket(State storage state, SellCreditMarketParams calldata params)
    external
    returns (uint256 cashAmountOut)
{
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(params.lender, msg.sender, cashAmountOut);
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(params.lender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fees);
}
```

To prevent this, we can add a check for the lender's balance in the pre-check stage.

## [L-04] The `isMulticall` flag is not correctly reset to `false` in the `multicall` function.

In the `multicall` function, we set `isMulticall` to true at the beginning and reset it to false at the end. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/Multicall.sol#L44

```
function multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data) internal returns (bytes[] memory results) {
    state.data.isMulticall = true;

    ...

    state.data.isMulticall = false;
}
```

However, if another `multicall` function is called within the initial `multicall` function, the `isMulticall` flag will be reset to false when the inner multicall function execution ends. If a subsequent `deposit` function follows, the cap check will be performed, which violates the `multicall` function design.

To prevent this, we should not allow an inner `multicall` function within another `multicall` function.

```
function multicall(State storage state, bytes[] calldata data) internal returns (bytes[] memory results) {
+    if (state.data.isMulticall == true) revert();
    state.data.isMulticall = true;

    ...

    state.data.isMulticall = false;
}
```

## [[L-05] Users cannot make compensation when the due date is within the minimum tenor period](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/102)

*Note: At the judgeâ€™s request [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size-findings/issues/127#issuecomment-2244619915), this downgraded issue from the same warden has been included in this report for completeness.*

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L60-L62

### Impact

Users can repay their debts partially. If they have other credits with due dates earlier than the debt they want to compensate for, they can always make the compensation regardless of whether the due date falls within the minimum tenor period.

However, it is not possible to create new debt/credit and compensate using this new credit if the due date is within the minimum tenor period. In such cases, the newly created debt and credit positions are just for compensation, and the owner is the same user, so the minimum tenor period check should not be necessary.

Imagine the minimum tenor period is long and a user has a large debt position. If the ETH price drops, their position may soon become liquidatable. If the user has some USDC but no ETH, they would want to repay their debt partially to increase their CR again. However, if the due date is within the minimum tenor period, they cannot do this. As a result, their position can be liquidated, leading to a loss.

The size of the loss depends on the debt size, so users will try to minimize the loss by reducing the debt size. Nevertheless, due to the unnecessary minimum tenor period check, users can still experience losses.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine Bob borrowed USDC from Alice, and Candy borrowed USDC from Bob. Both debts have the same due dates and are within the minimum tenor period. There is a fluctuation in the ETH price, prompting both users to want to reduce their debts.

In this scenario, Bob can compensate using the credit that Candy will pay to him. However, Candy cannot reduce his debt due to the minimum tenor period check.

```
function validateCompensate(State storage state, CompensateParams calldata params) external view {
    if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
        uint256 tenor = debtPositionToRepay.dueDate - block.timestamp;

        // validate tenor
        if (tenor < state.riskConfig.minTenor || tenor > state.riskConfig.maxTenor) {
            revert Errors.TENOR_OUT_OF_RANGE(tenor, state.riskConfig.minTenor, state.riskConfig.maxTenor); // @audit, here
        }
    } 
}
```

As previously mentioned, these newly created debt and credit positions are solely for compensation, and Candy owns both positions. This does not constitute actual lending/borrowing. Therefore, users should be allowed to create these positions even if the due date is within the minimum tenor period. It should be permissible because compensation can occur using credits with due dates within the minimum tenor period. In this context, there should be no distinction between these two methods.

Please add below test to the `test/local/actions/Compensate.t.sol`:

```
function test_Compensate_can_not_compensate_in_min_tenor() public {
    uint256 minTenor = size.riskConfig().minTenor;        

    _deposit(alice, usdc, 100e6);
    _deposit(bob, usdc, 50e6);
    _deposit(candy, usdc, 50e6);

    _deposit(bob, weth, 100e18);
    _deposit(candy, weth, 100e18);

    _buyCreditLimit(alice, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(365 days, 0.03e18));
    _buyCreditLimit(bob, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(365 days, 0.03e18));

    uint256 debtPositionIdOfBob = _sellCreditMarket(bob, alice, RESERVED_ID, 100e6, 365 days, true);
    uint256 creditPositionIdOfBob = size.data().nextCreditPositionId - 1;

    uint256 debtPositionIdOfCandy = _sellCreditMarket(candy, bob, RESERVED_ID, 50e6, 365 days, true);
    uint256 creditPositionIdOfCandy = size.data().nextCreditPositionId - 1;

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days - minTenor + 10);

    vm.prank(candy);
    // Candy cannot repay his debt
    vm.expectRevert(
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            Errors.TENOR_OUT_OF_RANGE.selector, 3590, minTenor, size.riskConfig().maxTenor
        )
    );
    size.compensate(
        CompensateParams({
            creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId: creditPositionIdOfCandy,
            creditPositionToCompensateId: RESERVED_ID,
            amount: 20e6
        })
    );

    vm.prank(bob);
    // Bob can repay his debt using his another credit
    size.compensate(
        CompensateParams({
            creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId: creditPositionIdOfBob,
            creditPositionToCompensateId: creditPositionIdOfCandy,
            amount: 20e6
        })
    );
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Please remove the minimum tenor period check from the compensate function.

### Impact

Users should always be able to repay their debts, even if the `borrowAToken` cap has been reached. This is crucial because positions can be liquidated if debts aren't repaid on time, leading to significant losses for users. However, in some cases, users cannot repay their debts due to precision errors. This issue stems from Size and Aave using different mathematical formulas in the calculation of scaled balances.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine the `borrowAToken` cap has been reached, and the current scaled total supply is denoted as `T`. To calculate the total supply, we use the formula `T * L / R`, where `L` represents the current liquidity index of the Aave pool and `R` is set as `RAY (1e27)`.

```
function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return _unscale(scaledTotalSupply());
}
function _unscale(uint256 scaledAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDivDown(scaledAmount, liquidityIndex(), WadRayMath.RAY);
}
```

Consider a user who has a debt `D` and wishes to repay it before maturity. This process should be achievable using multicall transactions, which typically involves two steps:
1. Deposit `D USDC` into Size.
2. These `D USDC` are supplied into the Aave Pool.

```
function depositUnderlyingBorrowTokenToVariablePool(State storage state, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
    external
{
    uint256 scaledBalanceBefore = aToken.scaledBalanceOf(address(this));
   
    state.data.variablePool.supply(address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken), amount, address(this), 0); // @audit, here
}
```

In the Aave pool, the scaled balance of these D USDC is minted back into Size.

```
function executeSupply(
  mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
  mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
  DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
  DataTypes.ExecuteSupplyParams memory params
) external {
  bool isFirstSupply = IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).mint(
    msg.sender,
    params.onBehalfOf,
    params.amount,  // @audit, here
    reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
  );
}
```

Aave employs a slightly different mathematical approach to calculate scaled balances. 

```
function _mintScaled(
  address caller,
  address onBehalfOf,
  uint256 amount,
  uint256 index
) internal returns (bool) {
  uint256 amountScaled = amount.rayDiv(index);  // @audit, here
  require(amountScaled != 0, Errors.INVALID_MINT_AMOUNT);
}
```

The scaled balance of `D USDC` is given by `(D * R + L / 2) / L`. 

```
function rayDiv(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {
  assembly {
    if or(iszero(b), iszero(iszero(gt(a, div(sub(not(0), div(b, 2)), RAY))))) {
      revert(0, 0)
    }

    c := div(add(mul(a, RAY), div(b, 2)), b)  // @audit, here
  }
}
```

Therefore, the increase in `borrowAToken` supply will be determined by this value.

```
function depositUnderlyingBorrowTokenToVariablePool(State storage state, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
    external
{
    uint256 scaledBalanceBefore = aToken.scaledBalanceOf(address(this));
    state.data.variablePool.supply(address(state.data.underlyingBorrowToken), amount, address(this), 0);
    uint256 scaledAmount = aToken.scaledBalanceOf(address(this)) - scaledBalanceBefore;

    state.data.borrowAToken.mintScaled(to, scaledAmount);  // @audit, here
}
```

Afterward, the user attempts to repay his debt. Obviously the debt decrease is `D`.

In certain cases, `(D * R + L / 2) / L` can exceed `D` by just `1 wei`. For instance, if `D` is `103,517,589` (can occur when `D` is an odd number) and `L` is `2e27`. This is possible and can easily occur with different values of `L`, then `(D * R + L / 2) / L` becomes `103,517,590`. Please check these values in the below test.

As a result of this precision discrepancy, the validation check will fail, preventing the user from repaying their debt as intended.

```
function validateBorrowATokenIncreaseLteDebtTokenDecrease(
    State storage state,
    uint256 borrowATokenSupplyBefore,
    uint256 debtTokenSupplyBefore,
    uint256 borrowATokenSupplyAfter,
    uint256 debtTokenSupplyAfter
) external view {
    if (borrowATokenSupplyAfter > state.riskConfig.borrowATokenCap) {
        uint256 borrowATokenSupplyIncrease = borrowATokenSupplyAfter > borrowATokenSupplyBefore
            ? borrowATokenSupplyAfter - borrowATokenSupplyBefore
            : 0;
        uint256 debtATokenSupplyDecrease =
            debtTokenSupplyBefore > debtTokenSupplyAfter ? debtTokenSupplyBefore - debtTokenSupplyAfter : 0;

        if (borrowATokenSupplyIncrease > debtATokenSupplyDecrease) { // @audit, here
            revert Errors.BORROW_ATOKEN_INCREASE_EXCEEDS_DEBT_TOKEN_DECREASE(
                borrowATokenSupplyIncrease, debtATokenSupplyDecrease
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Please add below test to the `test/local/actions/Multicall.t.sol`:

To conduct this test, we should implement the suggestion from that report, which involves using the total supply instead of the balance of Size in the multicall cap check.

```
function test_Multicall_repay_when_borrowAToken_cap() public {
    NonTransferrableScaledToken borrowAToken = size.data().borrowAToken;
    IERC20Metadata debtToken = IERC20Metadata(address(size.data().debtToken));

    _setLiquidityIndex(2e27);
    uint256 cap = 1000e6;
    _updateConfig("borrowATokenCap", cap);

    uint256 tenor = 365 days;
    _deposit(alice, usdc, cap);
    _buyCreditLimit(alice, block.timestamp + 365 days, YieldCurveHelper.pointCurve(tenor, 0.03e18));

    _deposit(bob, weth, 100e18);
    uint256 amount = 100e6 + 1;
    uint256 debtPositionId = _sellCreditMarket(bob, alice, RESERVED_ID, amount, tenor, false);

    // 103517589 (bob's debt)
    uint256 debtAmount = debtToken.balanceOf(bob); 
    _mint(address(usdc), bob, debtAmount);
    _approve(bob, address(usdc), address(size), debtAmount);

    // Bob should always be able to repay his full debt
    bytes[] memory data = new bytes[](2);
    data[0] = abi.encodeCall(size.deposit, DepositParams({token: address(usdc), amount: debtAmount, to: bob}));
    data[1] = abi.encodeCall(size.repay, RepayParams({debtPositionId: debtPositionId}));

    // The increase in the borrowAToken total supply exceeds the debt decrease by just 1 we
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(Errors.BORROW_ATOKEN_INCREASE_EXCEEDS_DEBT_TOKEN_DECREASE.selector, debtAmount + 1, debtAmount));
    vm.prank(bob);
    size.multicall(data);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To ensure consistency, aligning Size with Aave's calculation methods would be beneficial, though potential changes require careful consideration. Alternatively, a simple solution could be to incorporate a tolerance of 1 wei in the validation check.
